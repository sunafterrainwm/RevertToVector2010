RevertToVector2010
====
Rewrite URLs to force legacy Vector skin when user is not logged in.

[中文](README_zh.md)

In 2023, the Wikimedia Foundation gradually transitioned the default appearance of its various Wikimedia projects to Vector 2022. You can refer to the [English Wikipedia introduction to the Vector 2022 update](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vector_2022). While Vector 2022 does have its advantages, many people have difficulty adapting to its design.

This UserScript allows you to forcefully load the previous appearance, Vector 2010, even when not logged in.

## Installation Method
General:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunafterrainwm/RevertToVector2010/master/RevertToVector2010.user.js

Simultaneously rewrite versions of all links on the page:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunafterrainwm/RevertToVector2010/master/RevertToVector2010-extend.user.js

The latter option allows you to load one less page when clicking on links to other articles.

## Known Limitations and Reminders
1. Logged-in users should change the default appearance in their preferences.
2. Currently, it is only confirmed to work on Tampermonkey.
